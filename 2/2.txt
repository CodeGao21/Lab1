Gemini Code Assist in Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

It significantly enhances the productivity by providing intelligent code completion and
context-aware suggestions right as I write code. Also, 
it suggests relevant code snippets, function names, and 
variable types based on the context of my project. 

In the same way, Gemini Code Assist alerts of potential errors as I code,
which could save debugging time later on. 
Additionally, having documentation integrated directly into the editor is incredibly useful and 
I found a quickly access to API references and explore function definitions
without needing to switch between different windows or tabs,
making it easier to understand and implement complex code structures.
